## Installing

The easiest way to start using Martian is to download its binary distribution.

## Environment Setup

Append the folder where you installed the Martian binaries to your `PATH`. Verify that you can run the binaries:

~~~~
$ mrc --version
2.2.0
$ mrp --version
2.2.0
~~~~

Set `MROPATH` to a folder where you will write stage and pipeline code.
