## Installing Martian

Official binary distributions of the Martian toolchain are available for Linux, macOS and Windows:

|Download|OS|Arch|SHA256|
|---|---|---|---|
|[martian-2.3.0-rc0.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz](https://github.com/martian-lang/martian/releases/download/v2.3.0-rc0.1/martian-v2.3.0-rc0.1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz)|Linux|x86-64|
|Coming soon|macOS|x86-64|
|[Please contribute!](https://github.com/martian-lang/martian/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)|Windows|x86-64|

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
* [Go](https://golang.org) 1.8 or higher is required to build Martian.
* The Python adapter for wrapping stage code requires Python 2.7.
* To build the user interface, [Node](https://nodejs.org) 6 or higher is required, along with NPM.

### Building the source

To build the Martian toolchain from source, clone the [Martian GitHub repository](https://github.com/martian-lang/martian), run `make all`, and the compiled binaries will be generated in `bin/`.

~~~~
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/martian-lang/martian.git
$ cd martian
$ make all
$ ls bin
mrc  mrf  mrg  mrjob  mrp  mrs  mrstat
~~~~

To test that everything is working, `make longtests` runs a few simple test pipelines
and verifies that their output is correct, including test that pipeline failures are
handled correctly.

## Environment Setup

### Martian Executables

The Martian toolchain comprises five core executables:

|Executable|Role|Details|
|---|---|---|
|`mrc`|Compiler/Checker|Parses and validates Martian code
|`mrf`|Formatter|Canonicalizes Martian code formatting and whitespace
|`mrp`|Pipeline Runtime|Executes a Martian pipeline
|`mrs`|Stage Runtime|Executes an individual Martian pipeline stage
|`mrjob`|Stage wrapper|Wraps user stage code, ensuring it obeys the contracts `mrp` or `mrs` expect.

Make these executables available on your `PATH` and then confirm that you can run them. If you unpacked or cloned Martian into `/home/user/git/martian`, for example, then:

~~~~
$ export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/git/martian/bin
$ mrc --version
v2.3.0-rc0.1
~~~~

### Martian Project Path â€“ MROPATH

The code for a Martian pipeline project typically lives under a single directory. Set `MROPATH` to this directory to allow the Martian executables to find the project code without the need for absolute paths.

When developing multiple projects, switch between them by changing `MROPATH`.

To give you an idea of how a Martian project looks in practice, here's an example:

~~~~
martian_project/
    bin/
        hello_go
        hello_rust
    lib/
        go/
            vendor/github.com/martian-lang/martian
                src/martian/adapter/adapter.go
            src/
                hello_go.go
        rust/
            Cargo.lock
            Cargo.toml
            src/
                hello_rust.rs
    mro/
        _hello_stages.mro
        hello.mro
        stages/
            hello/
                hello_py/
                    __init__.py
