title: What is Martian?
type: index
---
Martian is a language and framework for developing and executing complex computational pipelines.

- Designed for simplicity: simple to learn, simple to develop, simple to run, and simple to debug.
- Allows you to combine software components written in any language into a single pipeline.
- Powerful support for scaling computationally intensive pipelines from standalone machines, to clusters, to cloud.
- Rich support for managing the full lifecycle of complex, data-intensive pipelines.

## Motivation & Design Goals

- Like any good developer tool, Martian seeks to reduce cognitive load, manage complexity and enhance tractablility.
- Simplicity. Things just makes sense when you look at them.
- No separate database or web server required.
- No boilerplate.
- Language is familiar. Eschew esotericity.
- Martian pipelines feature consistent structure, easy navigability, and rich provenance metadata.
- Support for managing data footprint at scale.
