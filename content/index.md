title: What is Martian?
type: index

Martian is a language and framework for developing and executing complex computational pipelines.


Increases performance and quality.
Manages complexity.

- Allows you to combine software components written in any language into a single pipeline
- Designed for simplicity: simple to learn, simple to develop, simple to run, simple to debug
- Powerful support for scaling computationally intensive pipelines from standalone machines, to clusters, to cloud
- Rich support for managing complex, data-intensive pipelines

## Motivation & Design Goals

- Like any good developer tool: Reduce cognitive load, manage complexity and enhance tractablility.
- Simplicity, just makes sense when you look at it, eschew esotericity
- Language is familiar, like the average person
- No boilerplate
- Why have a separate language
- No separate database or web server required
- Manage data growth
- Manage provenance
- Easy navigability
- Consistency
- Computability - code is obviously computable, but the codebase is not, machine reasoning about the structure of pipelines
