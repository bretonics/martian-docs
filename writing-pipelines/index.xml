      <description>Stages A stage is the fundamental unit of computation in Martian, and is composed with other stages into Martian pipelines, which are directed, acyclic graphs of stages.
In order to ensure pipelines can be restarted and parallelized safely, stage inputs are intended to be considered immutable, as are the outputs once the stage completes.
Martian stages can be implemented in any language, and each stage can even be implemented in a different language, if desired.</description>
