      <description>Martian was created at 10x Genomics, where it serves as a core part of the software engineering toolchain. As a developer framework, Martian helps to make tractable the design, development and maintenance of over 30 pipelines by 25+ developers. As a runtime, Martian has cumulatively executed, just internally at 10x Genomics, over 100 million jobs consuming 1.5 core-millennia of CPU time. Martian has executed many millions more core-hours at customer sites, and is one of the most heavily exercised computational pipeline frameworks deployed in the field.</description>
