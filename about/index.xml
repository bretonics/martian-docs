As a developer framework, Martian helps to make tractable the building and maintenance of over 30 pipelines by 25+ developers. As a runtime, Martian has cumulatively executed, just internally at 10x Genomics, over 91 million jobs consuming 1.3 core-millennia of CPU time. Martian has executed many millions more core-hours at customer sites, and is one of the most heavily exercised computational pipeline frameworks deployed in the field.</description>
